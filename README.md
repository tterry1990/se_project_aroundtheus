**Intro**

Hello! My name is Trevor Terry and this project is supposed to represent elements on different screen sizes with responsive web-design. Starting this project from scratch is most certainly a challenge but you'll never learn if you don't make mistakes. Below, you'll find a link to the actual project on Figma as well as my github!
