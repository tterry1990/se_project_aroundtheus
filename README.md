# Project 3: Around The U.S.

### Overview

Hello! My name is Trevor Terry and this project is supposed to represent elements on different screen sizes with responsive web-design. In this project, I started the code from scratch for the first time and was able to use grids and media queries. Starting this project from scratch is most certainly a challenge but you'll never learn if you don't make mistakes. Below, you'll find a link to the actual project on Figma as well as my github!
